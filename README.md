# A* Project

## Introduction

This repository contains a C program for processing data from CSV files and performing A* pathfinding algorithm operations. The code is organized into multiple source files within the "src" directory.

## Code Overview

The code is organized into the following files inside **src** directory:

- **Astar-algo.c**: This file contains the implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. It includes functions for finding the shortest path in a graph.
- **Astar-rw.c**: This file is responsible for reading data from CSV files, processing the data, and building a graph. It also handles writing the processed data to a binary file.
- **utils.h**: This header file likely contains function declarations and possibly data structures used in the main program files (Astar-algo.c and Astar-rw.c).
